# Plant_Disease_Investigation

## Introduction
This repo is part of my dissertation at the Univesity of Bath where we collected a dataset of Hyperspectral Images of Arabidopsis Plants infected with Albugo Candida at different stages of infection. A very simple ELM model has been implmented, and has been trained on the HSI images.

## Implementation
The files in this repo are as follows:
- `data/` - contains the HSI images
- `elm.py` - contains the ELM model
- `train.py` - contains the main function to run the model
- `analysis.py` - to analyse the results of the model
- `requirements.txt` - contains the required packages
- `SuccessiveProjectionsAlgorithm` - contains the SPA algorithm
